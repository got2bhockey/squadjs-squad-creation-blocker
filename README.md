# squadjs-squad-creation-blocker
The SquadCreationBlocker plugin is designed for SquadJS to manage and control squad creation in Squad servers. It prevents squads from being created within a specified time after a new game starts and at the end of a round. Additionally, it offers an optional feature to broadcast a countdown until squad creation is unlocked.
